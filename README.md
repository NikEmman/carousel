# carousel
This is my attempt at creating a custom carousel

## How to use
* Go to the html and find the container div ```<div class="container">```.
* For each image you want to include in the carousel, create a new div with the class "slide" and inside an <img> element.
```
   <div class="slide">
        <img src="(your image source)" alt="" />
    </div>
```
* JS takes care of the rest.
